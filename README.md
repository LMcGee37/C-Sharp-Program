-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
This application was to help students register for IT courses. It had to inform the user of the course list and what to do in order to register successfully.

-What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
I believe that my awareness in making sure to cover all possible issues in the application is what I did well. I had to make sure that the user couldn't sign up for the same class multiple times and couldn't register for more than the 9 total credit hours.

-Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The Console design only had text to work with, informing the user of the possible courses and what to enter in order to register. On the other hand, the WPF application design had a drop-down box with the course options, a confirm button, a text box that kept track of the registered courses, and a text box that kept track of the total credit hours. Both designs were successful in allowing the user to easily register for the courses.

-How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
In order to successfully debug the code without missing any errors, I would start by running the program to find where the errors start and to get an idea of what is wrong. I then read line by line to find any simple errors such as a missing ;, misspelling, or capitalization error. After this, I look for the more in depth issues and run the program after each fixed error. I will use this technique in the future to ensure that my debugging is thorough.

-Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
Throughout most of this course, I had mostly only debugged or wrote one or two lines of coding at most. So, for the final version of the application where I had to compose a rather lengthy amount of coding, I made a list for myself of all of the requirements and features that were needed and worked on each piece one step at a time and made sure that piece worked before moving on to the next to ensure I didn't forget anything.
